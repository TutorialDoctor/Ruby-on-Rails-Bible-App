A bible app made with Ruby on Rails for quick scripture access. This is going to be fun!

- [ ] Collect [Sketch App](https://www.sketchappsources.com/) resources. 
- [ ] Wireframes, mockups, and style guide with Sketch App and [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/)
- [ ] Prototype with HTML, CSS and Javascript.
- [ ] Create a new Rails app.
- [ ] Define Models and Controllers
- [ ] Determine what Gems are needed?
- [ ] Create initial Rails views based on prototype.
